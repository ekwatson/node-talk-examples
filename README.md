This is a set of example programs written for a presentation on Node.js. It includes
a Vagrantfile and a set of Chef cookbooks to build a working development environment
that includes redis and mongodb. You can read more about how to set up the Vagrant
Node.js environment by taking a look at my node-dev-bootstrap project, also available
on github. More about that can be found here:

To get the examples to work, you shouldn't have to use Vagrant -- you can install
Node.js and Redis on your local machine and run them locally.

For the examples that use the Twitter streaming API, you'll need to create an app
on Twitter at dev.twitter.com and then put the necessary credentials in a credentials.js
file in each of the directories. You can read more about how to do this here:
